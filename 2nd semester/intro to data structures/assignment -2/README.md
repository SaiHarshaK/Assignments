# Lab Assignment 2
## Question 1:
Suppose you are creating a linked list, where each node will contain CGPA of students. Consider a simple case where you know exactly 4 student CGPAs are entered. Since the number of inputs is known, go ahead with static allocation of objects and create a linked list to store this information. The CGPAs will be entered through console, and they will be placed in the linked list in the reverse order of their arrival, i.e. the first CGPA entered will be placed in the last node and the last CGPA entered will be the first node of the linked list (etc.). Implement this linked list using four structure variables. Your code should be able to take four inputs (CGPAs) from the console, and traverse the list (from the first node to the last node) to display the following details for each node:

1.Position of the node in the list
2.Address of the node
3.Value stored
4.The pointer stored in the node

## Question 2:

From the above problem statement, let us remove the constraint on the number of CGPA values entered through the console. That means, the list can now contain arbitrary number of elements. Create the link list using dynamic allocation of memory. Your code, just like earlier, should be having a function to traverse the list (from the first node to the last node) to display the details of the node (same details as in Question 1).
