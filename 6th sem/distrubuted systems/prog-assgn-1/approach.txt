In main, create n threads which would represent the n time servers.
Now in each thread:
  Spawn three threads.
    1. Send(), ask other server for time diff. This will run sequencially and ask rest n-1 servers as update can occur once at a time.
    2. Recv(), an inf loop which reports current time to everyone to asked.
    3. This is also an inf which updates drift time accordingly

Now each time server will be updated as some linear combination of other servers which would result in synchronization of error factor at some point.
