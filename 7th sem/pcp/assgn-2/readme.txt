1) Create a file "inp-params.txt". Here, input given will be parsed by the program
    Format to be followed is :

    n - number of threads
    k - number of CS accesses by each thread
    lam1, lam2 - avg of exponential distributions

    Example:
    16 10 1 2


2)
    a) Compile the program file by executing following command:
    g++ SrcAssgn2-CS17BTECH11036.cpp -lpthread -o program


3)
    a) Run the executable file by executing :
    ./program

4) Check “Filter.txt” and “PetersonTreeLock.txt” for the logs generated by the respectice locks in the simulation.
    Check stdout for average time taken by thread using the above locks to enter and exit the CS.
