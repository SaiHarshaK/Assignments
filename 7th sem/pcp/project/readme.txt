About:
    - queue_coarse_grained.cpp is the coarse grained implementation of queue
    - queue_paper.cpp is the implementation of queue given by paper
    - queue_proposed.cpp is the implementation of queue after modifications proposed

Instructions:
1) Create a file "inp-params.txt". Here, input given will be parsed by the program
    Format to be followed is :

    n - number of threads
    k - number of operations (enq/deq) by each thread

    Example:
    1 50


2)
    a) Compile the program file by executing following command:
    g++ queue_coarse_grained.cpp -lpthread -o coarse;
    g++ queue_paper.cpp -lpthread -o paper;
    g++ queue_proposed.cpp -lpthread -o proposed;

3)
    a) Run the executable file by executing (for example):
    ./coarse

4) Check “Fill_in_queue.txt” for the logs generated by the respective queue algorithm in the simulation.
    Check stdout for average time taken by an operation.
