Answer the following questions.

1. What is an IR? Why is it required?

2. What is LLVM-IR? Why is its main purpose? What is its design philosophy? What is MLIR? What is the main design philosophy of MLIR?

3. Read the Lexer and Parser codes of Kaleidoscope and Toy (from MLIR). Post some notes on the same. The notes should show some familiarity between of the internals of Lexer and Parser of both the language.
