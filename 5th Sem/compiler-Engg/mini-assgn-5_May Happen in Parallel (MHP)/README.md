# Mini Assgn 5 - May-Happen-in-Parallel (MHP)
What is May-Happen-in-Parallel (MHP) analysis?
How can MHP be useful in program analysis in finding bugs?
Does MHP on classic C/C++ (C99 and C++03) makes sense?
What language extensions enable parallel programming in C/C++?
Study how we can run MHP on parallel C/C++ programs to find bugs and what data structures/program representations are required to support such an analysis in high level language.

In the above context, design a strategy to perform MHP analysis on LLVM-IR. What granularity of code (Instruction/BasicBlock/Function) will be best suitable for such an analysis?

Document your findings in a report. This information will help you in Assignment 2.
