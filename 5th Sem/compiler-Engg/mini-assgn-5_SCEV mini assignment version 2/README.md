# Mini Assgn 5 - SCEV
We are posting another assignment on SCEV. The aim of the assignment is to see the effectiveness of SCEV pass.

You are provided with some sample programs in the attachment. Run the SCEV analysis pass on the given programs and study the SCEV expressions for respective programs. Also, show how the generated SCEV expressions are used by optimization pass(i.e. Loop Strength Reduction and other mentioned in first assignments) to optimize the code.

Record all your observations in a document.
